# <a name="overview"></a> Overview

A map of the environment plays a crucial role in our robotâ€™s navigation, guidance and path planning module. With the changing interiors in a room and each time letting the user map
manually is tedious. Having the robot to explore the entire room autonomously to build a map is very
essential for a product to be commercially successful. The objective of this project is to build a basic
turtlebot based frontier exploration package capable of autonomously navigating and building a map in a confined
room until the user is satisfied with the output using ROS and C++.

This repository is created as the part of ENPM808x Final Project to build an autonomous mobile robot for ACME Robotics, which navigates through an unexplored area and builds the map using simulated turtlebot platform. The software implements autonomous navigation and mapping capability using ROS nodes and services and the simulated turtlebot platform.

[Dependencies Installation steps](https://youtu.be/P_-cCO_jp-s)

# <a name="dependencies"></a> Dependencies
This project uses the following packages:
1. ROS noetic
2. Ubuntu 16.04
3. Packages Dependencies:

 * Turtlebot3 ROS packages
 * gmapping slam packages
 * roscpp
 * rospy
 * std_msgs
 * geometry_msgs
 * tf
 * rostest
 * rosbag
 * sensor_msgs
 * move_base_msgs


# <a name="algorithm"></a> Algorithm Overview
There are two path planning generators called   ```Linear Path Generator``` and ```Spiral Path Generator``` to generate the motion of the turtlebot in the simulated obstacle free environment. The ```Linear Path Generator``` generates a linear path for the turtlebot in the collision free area. Whereas, the later generates discrete spiral path. ```CollisionDetecter``` overrides ```Linear Path Generator``` and ```Spiral Path Generator``` whenever an object is in the vicinity of the turtlebot.


The ```CollisionDetecter``` algorithm divides the vicinity of the turtelbot into two areas : ```Front``` & ```Rear```. It then compares the obstacles in these two vicinities and make a decision either to move forward or to rotate. 

The ```Linear Path Generator``` or ```Spiral Path Generator``` kicks in back once both of the vicinities are obstacle free.

# <a name="installdepend"></a> Dependencies Installation
[A video is created demonstrating the below installation steps](https://youtu.be/P_-cCO_jp-s)

- ## Turtlebot3 packages installation
Following section will describe steps necessary to install turtlebot3 dependencies. Alternately you can follow from the
offical guide [here](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/setup/#setup)

  Install ROS turtlebot3 dependent packages:

  ```sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-teleop-twist-joy ros-noetic-teleop-twist-keyboard ros-noetic-laser-proc ros-noetic-rgbd-launch ros-noetic-depthimage-to-laserscan ros-noetic-rosserial-arduino ros-noetic-rosserial-python ros-noetic-rosserial-server ros-noetic-rosserial-client ros-noetic-rosserial-msgs ros-noetic-amcl ros-noetic-map-server ros-noetic-move-base ros-noetic-urdf ros-noetic-xacro ros-noetic-compressed-image-transport ros-noetic-rqt-image-view ros-noetic-gmapping ros-noetic-navigation ros-noetic-interactive-markers ros-noetic-hector-mapping```

  For Turtlebot3 packages follow the following steps:
  ```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_msgs.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3.git
git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```


- ## Sourcing
Open your bashrc file
```
gedit ~/.bashrc
```
Type the following in your bashrc file:

  Replace ```<IP>``` with your systems IP address
```
source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://<IP>:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=<IP>
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
 ```
save and close the bashrc file and source it
```source ~/.bashrc```

## Build Instructions
[A demo video is prepared to show build and run steps](https://youtu.be/Joi58ArrooQ)

If you followed above package dependencies installation section follow this else see the ```version2```
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/saimouli/frontier_exploration_turtlebot.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
## Version2
To build follow the following commands
```
mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
cd src/
git clone --recursive https://github.com/saimouli/frontier_exploration_turtlebot.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```

# <a name="tests"></a>Running Tests
- Level 1: unit tests
- Level 2: integration testsoth can run by the following command:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make run_tests frontierExplorer
```

# <a name="demo"></a> Running Demo
- Demo can be run by following the undermentioned instructions
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
roslaunch frontier_explorer_turtlebot demo.launch
```
On the terminal there will be set of instructions which required user input
```
Would you like to take linear path (0) or spiral path finer(1)? (Enter 0 or 1)
```
Based on the input the turtlebot will execute its exploration. Default is set to linear path. More about the spiral and linear search pattern is explained in the algorithm section.

  If you are satisfied with the map it produced press ctr+c on the terminal where you have given your input

  In a seperate terminal run
```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map
```

# <a name="rosbag"></a> ROSBAG

## Recording ROSBAG

 Record the rostopics using the following command with the launch file:
```
roslaunch frontier_explorer_turtlebot demo.launch record:=true
```
recorded bag file will be stored in the results folder and records all except camera topics

  To record for a specific time
```
roslaunch frontier_explorer_turtlebot demo.launch record:=true secs:=20
```
In the above case rosbag will record for 20 seconds

## Running ROSBAG
Navigate to the results folder
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/frontier_explorer_turtlebot/results
```
play the bag file
```
rosbag play turtlebotRecord.bag
```
## Inspecting ROSBAG
```rqt_bag``` is a GUI tool to inspect,view and publish the bag files.
Navigate to the results folder
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/frontier_explorer_turtlebot/results
```
play the bag file
```
rqt_bag turtlebotRecord.bag
```

# <a name="doc"></a>
# Doxygen Documentation
- If you'd still like to generate it then follow the instructions below
```
sudo apt-get install doxygen
sudo apt-get install doxywizard
doxywizard
```
When doxywizard is open, select the workspace as the repository. Fill in the details as required and set the source code folder to the repository as well. Create a new folder in the repository and select that as the destination directory. Proceed with the default settings and generate the documentation.

- Alternate way to generate and view doxygen document is as follows:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src/frontier_explorer_turtlebot/docs
doxygen explorerdoxy.doxyfile
cd html
firefox index.html
```
Refer to doxygen document :
[Doxygen Document](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/saimouli/frontier_exploration_turtlebot/blob/master/docs/html/index.html)


# <a name="coverage"></a> Coverage
- The current code coverage for the project is 92.0%.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/build
lcov --directory . --capture --output-file coverage.info
lcov --list coverage.info
```
This will output the coverage of each file in the terminal. To create an html file for the same, run the following command.
```
genhtml coverage.info --output-directory covout
```
This will store the ```index.html``` file in the folder ```covout```
# <a name="issue"></a>
# Known Issues
Navigation: Sometimes when launching the turtlbot3 simulation might get stuck. In that case please relaunch the simulation using the launch file 

While building the slam authors assumed the environment is filled with obstacles. If there is an empty room the built slam map will not be a good estimate. 

If the user chooses a spiral trajectory generator, the map will build sooner but might also distort because of too many rotations involved. The 2d slam methods are bad as they drift a lot. In the next version, authors are trying to integrate RGBD slam.
